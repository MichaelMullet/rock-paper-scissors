# rock-paper-scissors
### A quick and easy rock paper scissors game

This was one of my first programs and introduced me to **python loops**. You can choose to enter `r`, `p`, `s`, or `q` to play rock, paper, scissors, or quit the game. 

You play against the computer which chooses randomly between `r`, `p`, and `s`. The program stores your name and tallies your score with *wins*, *losses*, and *ties*. Entering `q` will terminate the program.
